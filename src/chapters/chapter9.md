## What to do next

We've looked at some pretty cool things together today, but didn't have time to cover a ton of other topics, including:

* data binding
* list elements and item templates
* plugins
* device orientation and size detection
* file system access
* hardware devices (camera, location services, touch id)
* dozens of UI elements

Go through a few more examples on the [NativeScipt website](http://docs.nativescript.org/) to learn more. 

You can also take a look at a new Pokedex app I'm working on. The [source code](https://github.com/mikebranstein/nativescript-pokedex) is on Github.
