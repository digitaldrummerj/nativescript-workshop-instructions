## Getting up and running

If you're attending a live workshop with one of the [Brosteins](https://brosteins.com) ([Mike Branstein](https://twitter.com/mikebranstein) or [Nick Branstein](https://twitter.com/nickbranstein)), we've likely provided you with a pre-configured laptop! 

Sweet!

There's nothing else you need to do, (except power on your laptop). Turn it on and let's get to it! 

### Laptop login 

If you're using a laptop I've provided to you, you can login with these credentials:

* Username: `dev`
* Password: `p@ssw0rd`

### Configuring your own environment

If you're doing the lab on your own, you'll need to set everything up by yourself. Check out the NativeScript [website](http://docs.nativescript.org/angular/start/quick-setup) on how to get started by installing and configuring NativeScript.

I recommend you follow the *Advanced Setup* instructions for installation:

* [Advanced setup: Windows](http://docs.nativescript.org/angular/start/ns-setup-win)
* [Advanced setup: OS X](http://docs.nativescript.org/angular/start/ns-setup-os-x)
* [Advanced setup: Linux](http://docs.nativescript.org/angular/start/ns-setup-linux)
